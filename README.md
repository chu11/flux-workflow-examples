**Flux Workflow Examples**

**_1. [CLI: Job Submission](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-workflow-examples/tree/master/job-submit-cli)_**

Launch a flux instance and schedule/launch compute and io-forwarding jobs on
separate nodes using the CLI

**_2. [Python: Job Submission](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-workflow-examples/tree/master/job-submit-api)_**

Schedule/launch compute and io-forwarding jobs on separate nodes using the Python bindings

**_3. [Python: Job Submit/Wait](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-workflow-examples/tree/master/job-submit-wait)_**

Submit jobs and wait for them to complete using the Flux Python bindings

**_4. [Python: Asynchronous Bulk Job Submission](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-workflow-examples/tree/master/async-bulk-job-submit)_**

Asynchronously submit jobspec files from a directory and wait for them to complete in any order

**_5. [Python: Tracking Job Status and Events](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-workflow-examples/tree/master/job-status-control)_**

Submit job bundles, get event updates, and wait until all jobs complete

**_6. [Python: Job Cancellation](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-workflow-examples/tree/master/job-cancel)_**

Cancel a running job

**_7. [Lua: Use Events](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-workflow-examples/tree/master/synchronize-events)_**

Use events to synchronize compute and io-forwarding jobs running on separate
nodes

**_8. [Python: Simple KVS Example](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-workflow-examples/tree/master/kvs-python-bindings)_**

Use KVS Python interfaces to store user data into KVS

**_9. [CLI/Lua: Job Ensemble Submitted with a New Flux Instance](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-workflow-examples/tree/master/job-ensemble)_**

Submit job bundles, print live job events, and exit when all jobs are complete

**_10. [CLI: Hierarchical Launching](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-workflow-examples/tree/master/hierarchical-launching)_**

Launch a large number of sleep 0 jobs

**_11. [C/Lua: Use a Flux Comms Module](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-workflow-examples/tree/master/comms-module)_**

Use a Flux Comms Module to communicate with job elements

**_12. [C/Python: A Data Conduit Strategy](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-workflow-examples/tree/master/data-conduit)_**

Attach to a job that receives OS time data from compute jobs
